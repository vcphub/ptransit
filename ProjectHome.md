Many public transit organizations/agencies use **non-standard methods and data formats** to store and manage its schedule data. With non-standard schedule data, it is very difficult to **regularly publish accurate and up-to-date timetable**. Therefore, agencies do **not** bother publishing the timetable. This is especially true for bus transportation agencies in developing countries like India, including bus transportation agency in Pune, PMPML (as of January 2010).

On the other hand, passengers using public transportation service **need easy access to timetable**. Passengers want accurate, up-to-date and relevant timetable information.

Objective of this project is to develop software tools to process & convert non-standard schedule data into HTML timetable and other useful formats (PDF, GTFS).

Overall objective of project is help passengers access complete, accurate and latest timetable using different communication channels (PC & Internet, printed pamphlets and mobile phones.). This should encourage more people to use public transportation whenever possible.
